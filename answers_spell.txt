a. The spell class is parent of both Accio and Confundo subclasses

b. The code is weirdly indented on the pdf. If study_spell is a function but not a method, the output is :
"Accio
Summoning Charm Accio
This charm summons an object to the caster, potentially over a significant distance
Confundus Charm Confundo
Causes the victim to become confused and befuddled"
Otherwise, it prints an error, since study_spell is unknown

c. It is the method from the Confundo class which gets called

d. The get_description method needs to be added to override its parent's version. The code is provided in spell.py
